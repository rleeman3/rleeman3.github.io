<h3 class="section-heading">There were two whales swimming in the ocean.</h3>

When I hear about a talent show, signing up for it is not a question. Not because I'm full of talents, but because my mother taught me always to participate. Unfortunately, she did not pass onto me the talent of having an incredible voice, or being able to juggle, or being able to burp the ABCs (she can do that, so it's really unfair that I can't).

What I can do:
hula hoop
walk on stilts
do a split
do a decent cartwheel
do a handstand (sometimes - other times I fall over)
blow spit bubbles
read poetry (in the sense that I am literate)

When iXperience announced it was hosting a talent show, I immediately signed myself up for an act with my bffs, Rebecca & Menachem. We knew our next step was to brainstorm our talent.

We considered our skills.
Since we're in Africa, we could not get hula hoops or stilts.

We considered performing a <i>Pesach Seder</i> onstage. We decided that could be a <i>chillul Hashem</i>.

We chose to do comedy. Please enjoy this video. Please ROFL (this is one of the ONLY times it is okay for this 'ROFL' phrase to be used - it is okay now because my hope is that you react to this video by rolling on the floor laughing. I am a literal person, though, and do not appreciate when people respond 'ROFL' to jokes that probably fail even to make them smile.).

The infamous whale joke:

Another instance where 'ROFL' is appropriate:
