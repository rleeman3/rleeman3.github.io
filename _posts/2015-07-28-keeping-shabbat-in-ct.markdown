<h3>I believe the Sabbath; I keep the Sabbath. <i><small> - John Harvey Kellogg</small></i><br>Don't I??</h3>

<p>I keep <i>Shabbat</i>. No, I do not attend <i>shul</i> every Friday night and Saturday (although my Saturday attendance record is decent if counting all the times I've arrived at noon, just in time for the <i>kiddushim</i>. My father made sure to walk by to my house from services to pull me and my four sisters out of bed whenever Yaffa is catering, a big-donor is sponsoring, or there is really good <i>chullent</i>.
<br>
No, I do not usually light the Friday night candles. I sometimes talk during <i>shalom aleichem</i>. I've gone thru quite a few <i>Shabbatot</i> when I have not paused for a single moment to think about G-d.
<br><br>
So, you might be thinking: 'FAKE!'
Or, maybe: 'It doesn't sound like you keep Shab for G-d, so why do you burden yourself with it?'
<br>
My answers: 1) F all the h8ers. 2) I do it for myself. Carry on, eager readers!

<h3>Sometimes keeping Shabbat is really, really easy.</h3>

<p>Sometimes I'm in Israel- then it's simple. And when I keep it with my family, I virtually am being spoon-fed my obligation.</p>
<h3>And sometimes it's really damn hard.</h3>

<p>Like when I'm stuck on Long Street in Africa, or when I've just completed a half-marathon and am stuck 13 miles away from my destination and it's pouring down rain.</p>
<h3>I really want to love Shabbat. If refusing to allow myself to turn the light off before bed will cause me to begrudge Shabbat, shouldn't I just hit the damn switch? What's the big deal? Isn't it more important that I maintain a favorable opinion of the Sabbath?</h3>
<h3>I've learned that there's no compromising. If you want to do Shabbat, commit to it. Fully fledge.</h3>

<p>If I go to a Shabbat dinner with the plan of attending a frat party or Club 31 after, even if my plan is to walk there so that I will not "break" Shabbat, my head is going to be in the wrong place the whole time I am trying to "do" Shabbat and I will not be able to enjoy it. I will detest every <i>d'var torah</i> that I otherwise would've considered beautiful, simply because I will be in a rush. I will hate any schmoozing that takes place amongst all the guests who are doing Shabbat correctly. Celebrating Shabbat all-or-nothing commitment.</p>
