<h1> It's my last night in Cape Town </h1>
<h2> ...time flies when you're having fun </h2>

<p> Tali and I bought champagne for our last night. You know. We are classy. We celebrate right! Anyway, Tali organized our own goodbye party at the IX house, but sadly not one other IX student showed up. Seriously. It was only us two.</p>
<p> Check out the FB event Tali made so you can get an idea of what we were expecting!! <a href="https://"></a> </p>


<p> I pop the bottle and the cork goes flying/\. The couch got a little wet. Okay, so midway through our raging pregame, Wick (Session 3 coder working on his final project) enters the room. He asks for coding help, and is surprised that no one wants to help him. He then shouts, "Is it JUST you 2 drinking alone?" Tali responds, "Yeah. WOW. Is it just you and Arthur coding alone?" </p>


<p> His comments did not bother me. Just made me realize how much I love Tali! ...They did bother Tali.</p>
<p> Shortly after, Aaron, the CEO of iXperience, and his GF, Sparkles, (Did you know her real name is Sabeega??!?) join us... At this point, the champagne is done and we are drinkning tequilla.  Although not many people came to our goodbye party, as our friend Daniel Zhau says, "nothing good ever happens in groups larger than four." </p>


<p> We uber down to Long Street and meet our IX finance friends at Stones for some pool. Suddenly, I get many intense, serious texts from Tali that go like this, "HELP! HELP!! I'm locked in the toilet stall!!!!!!!!! Help me!" 
Before I can process this, panicked Chris James Morgan comes RUNNING over to inform me that Tali is stuck. Arm in arm, we dash to the bathroom to rescue Tali. Chris leaves me to enter the Women's bathroom. I hear Tali screaming and so I punch the door hard, but nothing happens. So I kick the door and thankfully it worked! I have never seen Tali this overjoyed. I WAS HER HERO :)
Craziest part of the night though was that I also got locked in right after, 'cause I thought I had fixed the problem... but issue was there was no handle bar to use. Thankfully Tali was still there to save me!

The night did get better. Don't worry.

-Nick Montgomery Longaker and I bonded over the fact that I'll be visiting him in Arizona on my family trip. (We actually went through the full google doc itinerary together and he gave me good recs)

-Brandon, our Societi Bistro waiter friend, turns out to be Jewish. Brandon Epstein. Get more Jewish. 

-Cuan, Switch Workout Class Instructor Hottie, kept trying to meet up with us before his 10PM bedtime. #5:45AMSwitchClass

-Mc. Flurries!!!!!!

-Raj bought the photo of me, Aryan and Raj from Stones. The photo is just funny cause it looks like I have such diverse friends.

-We danced all night at Fiction...

-Last but not least, Tali and I made killer toasts to each other.
</p>
<p> I love Cape Town and would never reallyyy be ready to leave but this definetely a good last night!</p>
