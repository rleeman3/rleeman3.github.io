<h1>I've always loved  <i>learning</i> basically anything and everything.</h1>


<p>
This summer I decided to break away from my routine summers at Camp Ramah and go learn Computer Science in South Africa. <i>Why not?</i> It was a little risky. But so rewarding. I went out of my comfort zone and ended up meeting incredible people, becoming a web developer and trying all sorts of crazy new things. One big hardship was that I was seperated from my Michigan community. I miss everyone and I can't wait to start back up in the Fall as a Sophomore.</p> 

<h2>Here is to my Michigan family. I can't wait to be reunited in three weeks!</h2>
