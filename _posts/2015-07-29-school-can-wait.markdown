<h3>I've always loved  <i>learning</i> basically anything.</h3>

 <p>
This summer I decided to break away from my routine summers at Camp Ramah and go learn Computer Science in South Africa. Why not? It was a little risky. But so rewarding. I went out of my comfort zone and ending up meeting incredible people, becoming a web developer and trying all sorts of crazy new things. The only thing was that I was seperated from my Michigan community.</p> 

<h3>Here is to my Michigan family. I can't wait to be reunited in three weeks!</h3>
