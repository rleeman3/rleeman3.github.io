<h3>All my life, I feel like I've made the <i>right</i> choices.</h3>

 nights, new soul mates, friends to call family. To crazy nights we can't remember, bad decisions that turn into great stories, moments that turn into memories. To losing our breath, getting our breath taken away, cheesy quotes, chasing views, constantly learning. To food that tastes so good we wish it never existed, trying everything once, embracing and welcoming the unknown.</p>
